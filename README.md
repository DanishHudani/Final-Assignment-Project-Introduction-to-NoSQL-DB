# Introduction to NoSQL Databases by IBM
## Final Project

Analyze and Load data from IBM Cloudant NoSQL DB to local server in MongoDB and Cassandra.

### Scenario

You are a data engineer at a Data Analytics Consulting Company. Your company prides itself in being able to efficiently handle data in any format on any database on any platform. Analysts in the offices need to work with data on different databases, and with data in different formats. While they are good at analyzing data, they count on you to be able to move data from external sources into various databases, move data from one type of database to another, and be able to run basic queries on various databases.

- Task 1: Replicate a remote database into your Cloudant instance.
- Task 2: Create an index for key "director", on the database movies using the HTTP API.
- Task 3: Write a query to find all movies directed by Richard Gage using the HTTP API.
- Task 4: Create an index for key "title", on the database movies using the HTTP API.
- Task 5: Write a query to list only the keys year and director for the movie "Top Dog" using the HTTP API.
- Task 6: Export the data from movies database into a file named movies.json.

- Task 10: Write a query to find out the average votes for movies released in 2007.
- Task 11: Export the fields _id, title, year, rating and director from movies collection into a file named partial_data.csv.
- Task 12: Import partial_data.csv into cassandra server into a keyspace named entertainment and table named movies.
- Task 13: Write a cql query to count the number of rows in the movies table.
- Task 14: Create an index for the column rating in the movies table using cql.
- Task 15: Write a cql query to count the number of in the movies that are rated 'G'.
